# Overcooked-Robot

``cd QtOvercooked`` and then use ``QtOvercooked`` command to enjoy the game.

``QtOvercooked`` has two parameters:

``-l``, necessary, the path to the map, see ``Robot/maps`` for details.

``-p``, selectable, the path to the building result of Robot, must be a executable file.

If there is no ``-p`` parameter, you can play the game by yourself (without a robot).
